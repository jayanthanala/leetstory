LeetStory
Level up your LeetCode practice by transforming coding problems into engaging, real-world interview scenarios at top tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon (MAANG).

What is LeetStory?
LeetStory is a Chrome extension designed to make your LeetCode grind more immersive and effective. Instead of just reading a technical problem description, LeetStory rephrases the problem as if it were a question being asked in a job interview at your dream company. This helps you:

Understand the "Why": See the practical application of algorithms and data structures in real-world contexts.

Improve Communication: Start thinking about how to explain your approach in a more conversational, interview-like setting.

Stay Engaged: Turn the often dry problem descriptions into interesting scenarios.
