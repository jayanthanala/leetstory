# LeetStory ðŸš€

> Level up your LeetCode practice by transforming coding problems into engaging, real-world interview scenarios at top tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon (MAANG).

## What is LeetStory?

**LeetStory** is a Chrome extension designed to make your LeetCode grind more immersive and effective. Instead of just reading a technical problem description, LeetStory rephrases the problem as if it were a question being asked in a job interview at your dream company. This helps you:

  * **Understand the "Why"**: See the practical application of algorithms and data structures in real-world contexts.
  * **Improve Communication**: Start thinking about how to explain your approach in a more conversational, interview-like setting.
  * **Stay Engaged**: Turn the often dry problem descriptions into interesting scenarios.
